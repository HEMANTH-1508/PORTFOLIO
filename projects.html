        <h2>Project Title</h2>
        <h3>Comparative Analysis of Advanced Algorithms for Brain Tumor Detection</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of various algorithms for detecting brain tumors using MRI scans. 
            The study compared the effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Fuzzy C-Means clustering in accurately identifying and segmenting tumors. 
            By evaluating these algorithms' performance, the project aimed to optimize detection accuracy and enhance diagnostic reliability. 
            The work involved developing and testing each algorithm, followed by a detailed performance assessment to determine the most effective approach.

        <p>
            These images depict MRI scans showing brain tumors. Each image highlights the presence of a tumor, demonstrating the importance of accurate detection and diagnosis in medical imaging.

        <p>
            In this project, I played a pivotal role in developing and implementing the algorithms for brain tumor detection. 
            Under the guidance of my college faculties, I collaborated closely with professors and research assistants. 
            My responsibilities included researching various detection algorithms, programming and testing these methods, and analyzing their performance.
